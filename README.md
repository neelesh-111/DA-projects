# Hospitality Domain analysis

In this project, I worked on the data of AtliQ Grands, which owns multiple five-star hotels across India. Using the given data, I created several key metrics, including:

âž¡Revenue: Revenue generated along the given timeline.
âž¡Occupancy %: Rooms occupied during weekdays and weekends.
âž¡RevPAR: Revenue per available room
âž¡Realization %: percentage of actual revenue earned compared to the maximum potential revenue based on full occupancy at standard rates.
âž¡ADR: Average Daily Rate
âž¡DSRN: Daily Sellable room nights 
âž¡DURN: Daily Utilized room nights
âž¡DBRN: Daily Booked room nights

Using DAX measures and extensive analysis, I helped transform raw data into actionable insights that can drive business decisions!

 Here's what I worked on:
âœ” Data Cleaning to ensure accuracy
âœ” Data Transformation to organize the dataset
âœ” Data Modeling for better structure
